Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Overview:
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as well as they should. Because of this, excess fluid and waste from blood remain in the body and may cause other health problems, such as heart disease and stroke.

Dietary Guidelines for CKD:
- Sodium: Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day. Avoid processed foods.
- Protein: For Stages 1-2, moderate protein is okay. Stages 3-5 (non-dialysis) often require protein restriction to reduce kidney workload.
- Potassium: High potassium foods (bananas, potatoes, tomatoes) may need to be limited if blood tests show high potassium levels.
- Phosphorus: Limit dairy, nuts, seeds, and distinct soft drinks if phosphorus levels are high.

Symptoms to Watch:
- Fatigue and weakness
- Swelling in feet and ankles (edema)
- Changes in urination frequency
- Loss of appetite or nausea
- Shortness of breath

When to see a doctor immediately:
If you experience sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or cannot urinate, seek emergency care.
